5.	DOCUMENTATION
=====================
The program is called with the following command (incl. example input arg)

	./push_swap "1337 42 19 -16" 	OR	./push_swap 1337 42 19 -16

'stack a' points to the TOP of the stack, which is 1337 in this case:

	*a -> [1337 (TOP)] -> [42] -> [19] -> [-16 (last or bottom)] -> NULL

the goal is to have this stack in ascending order, which would be:

	*a -> [-16 (TOP)] -> [19] -> [42] -> [1337 (last or bottom)] -> NULL
