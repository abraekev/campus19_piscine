Beneath a blanket of stars, an old lighthouse stood guard on a craggy shore, its light a solitary beacon in the night.
A stormy evening brought a mysterious ship, unseen for centuries, gliding silently towards the coast.
The lighthouse keeper, an old man with countless tales, watched in awe as ghostly figures repaired the timeworn vessel.
As dawn broke, the ship set sail, vanishing into the morning mist, leaving behind an ancient map marked with the path to lost treasures.
